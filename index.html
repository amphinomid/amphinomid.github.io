	I'm a journalist in Little Rock, Arkansas.

	<br /><br />
	As a disoriented Stanford student I joined the campus paper on a whim,
	where I cut my teeth in reporting and later edited the News section and
	<a href="https://stanforddaily.com/category/equity-project/">Equity
		Project</a>.
	But it was at a summer gig at <a href="https://missionlocal.org">Mission
		Local</a> (supported, crucially, by a
	<a href="https://comm.stanford.edu/internships/rebele">university grant</a>)
	where I really fell in love with the work.
	In the ensuing years I
	moved around some
	and did all that one does when twentysomething and going insane for the
	first time.
	In another life, I researched
	<a href="https://esrg.stanford.edu">online</a>
	<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity25/presentation/han">safety</a>
	and got a bachelor's with honors in computer science, focusing on
	systems.
