	I'm a journalist in Little Rock, Arkansas. Reach me at amphinomid at
	gmail dot com.
	<br /><br />
	I cut my teeth at The Stanford Daily and later edited its News section
	and
	<a href="https://stanforddaily.com/category/equity-project/">Equity
		Project</a>;
	spent a summer flitting about San Francisco on the Muni,
	running into the frigid Pacific, learning astonishing and delightful things
	writing for Mission Local (supported by a
	<a href="https://comm.stanford.edu/internships/rebele">Rebele grant</a>).
	Then moved around and wrote more and
	did all the other things one does when twentysomething and going insane for the first time.
	In what feels like another life, I researched
	<a href="https://esrg.stanford.edu">online safety</a>
	and got a bachelor's with honors in computer science, focusing on
	systems.
